# Persona-Panels
<h3> Description </h3>
Experiential Project for [persona panels](https://personapanels.com/).

Persona Panels is an AI Market Research company that provides persona animated bots- designed to mimic target consumer behavior. Everyday the bots consume information over the internet that further influences their future choices. These bots are then used to perform market research to test client products and services. We were tasked with analyzing this monitoring data for the [Millennial Persona Panel](https://personapanels.com/millennial-persona-panel/) to compare and evaluate and the bot performance. We were supposed to find interesting similarities, differences and any such insights that might help understand the personas better.

<h3>Process</h3>
<i>Descriptive Analysis- Exploratory Data Analysis</i>: This consists of basic descriptive statistics for each millennial- their most observed keywords, least observed keywords, the common keywords among all millennials, and so on. I also perform correlation analysis to see which keywords are highly collinear.

<i>Inferential Analysis</i>- Making inferences and testing different hypotheses on the data.

<i>Similarity based on common themes</i>: Here we look into each persona- analyzing them separately. Performing a correlation analysis to figure out what keywords were highly correlated with one another, categorizing keywords to look into the underlying patterns and interests of the persona, etc. Based on the keywords that fall under these categories, the personas are compared with each to see what percentage of their keywords fit into each of these themes.

<i>Similarity based on common keywords</i>: To understand what millennial pairs are most similar to one another, using the number of keywords in common as the deciding factor.

<i>Volatility of Personas</i>: The volatility of each persona will be measured- ie, month to month how much do the top keywords of each persona change. It the number of keywords is less, it can be concluded that the persona largely remains stable, and vice versa.

*Time Series Analysis*: Since we have temporal data, time series analysis can be performed for all of the keywords of each persona, to view the trends. Forecasting will also be performed to predict future trends.
