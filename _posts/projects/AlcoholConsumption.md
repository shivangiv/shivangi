<h2>Columbia University - Helios</h2>

<span class="tools">Jekyll, HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript</span>

<h3>Research</h3>

The current team needed a way to create simple web pages without resorting to websites like Squarespace, Wix, or WordPress. I had to research several static website generators, and present one that is the best suited for the team at CCNMTL (Columbia Universityâ€™s Center for New Media Teaching and Learning). I ended up using Jekyll because the liquid formatter is friendly, and designers who are not keen on sifting through code could easily append a post, and that post could be converted into a component on the website. 
        
<h3>Processs</h3>

The original website can be accessed <a href="http://html5up.net/helios">here</a>. This was a project I did for Columbia University's <a href="http://welcome.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">Center for New Media Teaching and Learning</a>(CCNMTL). This is the converted version of the original into a <em>Jekyllified</em> format. Users can add posts and it appends each post as a card in the carousel. With this Jekyll ready template, content is easier to add and manage without needing to dig through several files of HTML. All the user has to do is edit the post, similar to Drupal's or WordPress's content WYSIWG creator.

<h2>Columbia University - Bill Tool</h2>

<span class="tools">HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript, Drupal</span>

<h3>Research</h3>

Roughly, there are 32,000 and more students enrolled at Columbia University that may need to see the total cost of their tuition. Couple that with the parents who are also concerned about the payment, then there is a hefty number of users that would generally want to calculate how much money they are paying to Columbia University. While I was interning at CCIT (Columbia College Information Technology), I was tasked to optimize their Bill Estimator Tool, and append an option for loans.  
        
<h3>Processs</h3>

The general styling of the table did not need any changes, but I realized that there needs to be more interaction for the loan options. I consolidated the loans into a drop-down input which consists of four options. Selecting a loan would add an input text box above the drop-down input, where users can enter the value of the respective loan. If for some reason, the user wants to remove a certain loan, a delete button is attached to the right side, and on hover, the user would be notified that they can remove the said loan.
