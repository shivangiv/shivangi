<h2>Data Analysis for Market Research</h2>

<span class="tools">R, Tableau, Microsoft Excel</span>

<h3>Description</h3>

Persona Panels is an AI Market Research company that provides persona animated bots- designed to mimic target consumer behavior. Everyday the bots consume information over the internet that further influences their future choices. These bots are then used to perform market research to test client products and services. We were tasked with analyzing this monitoring data for the (Millennial Persona Panel)[https://personapanels.com/millennial-persona-panel/] to compare and evaluate and the bot performance. We were supposed to find interesting similarities, differences and any such insights that might help understand the personas better.

<h3>Process</h3>

Each persona has a set of keywords relating to their interests associated with them; these are monitored daily. I looked at the top most observable and least observable keywords for each persona, common keywords among personas, and the trends. I categorized all keywords with themes like Political, Lifestyle, Family Oriented, and Technology, to see how the interests were distributed among all keywords.

Time series analysis of the keywords was performed using the appropriate time series model to view future upward or downward trends in the interests of the personas.
