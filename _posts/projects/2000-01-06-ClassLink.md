<h2>ClassLink - App Library</h2>

<span class="tools">Figma, HTM5, SCSS, JavaScript</span>

<h3>Research</h3>

ClassLink App Library is a component of a larger application, OneClick. Essentially, OneClick is a launch pad for other applications where students and teachers can access the applications they need in one place. Most of the users are students, which can range from kindergarten to twelfth grade. The former design conformed to a decade old paradigm that had glossy buttons and uneasy navigation. I pushed the design forward to a cleaner layout.
        
<h3>Processs</h3>

I was tasked with converting the final design into a responsive and interactable website. The former component used Bootstrap and jQuery, which were both heavy frameworks for this type of implementation. I decided to simplify the process and opted to write the front-end with pure HTML5, SCSS, and JavaScript. I also used CodePen as a storage and display for the code, so the project is easily shareable.

<h2>ClassLink - Wizard</h2>

<span class="tools">Adobe Illustrator, Angular 6, HTML5, SCSS, TypeScript</span>

<h3>Research</h3>

ClassLinkâ€™s main application is OneClick, which essentially acts as a launch pad or dashboard for students, teachers, and administrators to quickly access their added applications by means of single-sign on.  I was tasked to redesign a start-up wizard to ease the process of onboarding new ClassLink users. I had to bear in mind that the design needs to be user-friendly to both children and adults.
        
<h3>Processs</h3>

The process took a couple of iterations before arriving at the final process. I initially used Figma to design the mock-ups, then moved to CodePen, and finally converting the project into an Angular 6 application. There are five steps--choosing a profile image, setting up password, enabling two-factor authentication, linking social accounts, and setting up other methods of signing on via QR code and facial recognition. The left side is a complete demarcation of the process. Therefore, the user can easily see the current progress of their profile setup.

<h2>ClassLink - Badges</h2>

<span class="tools">Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Figma</span>

<h3>Research</h3>

Many of the users that will use the ClassLink Badging application consists of teachers and students, as well as administrators in school districts. Badges are used to gamify the classroom as validated indicators of accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest. The teachers or admins often distribute the badges, and the students receive them. Therefore, designing the badges required more attention to the visual cue of the students.
        
<h3>Processs</h3>

These are templates and not fixed badges, so users can customize the icon and text of the badge. There are three different types of badges. I separated them into three sets. The first set consists of badges with only text, the second set consists of badges with only an image, and the last set of badges have both text and image. I have also curtailed a specific range of colors for these badges. Each color palette consists of five colors, and each color in a palette is established with a certain amount of brightness, which keeps the badges consistent. I mainly used Illustrator to design the badges, and later exported the badges to Figma for ease of access.
