<p class="para"> <br> <i>Real Estate have announced a new album, In Mind—the follow-up to their 2014 LP Atlas. It’s out March 17 via Domino. They have also shared the first song from the record, as well as its accompanying music video. The “Darling” video (directed by Weird Days) features the band performing casually next to a horse. Watch it below.
Real Estate recorded In Mind in Los Angeles with producer Cole M.G.N. (who’s worked with Beck, Julia Holter, and more). It is the band’s first full-length since the departure of founding member and guitarist Matt Mondanile, who left last May citing a desire to focus on his own Ducktails project. The album features their new member, guitarist Julian Lynch.</i>
